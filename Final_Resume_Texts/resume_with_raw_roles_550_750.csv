I was hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3 accreditation packages each leading to
successful Authorization To Operate decisions. 
Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3
successful ATOs. 
Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. 
Succeeded in writing and implementing
vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. 
Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design
decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand
the best fit for the program. 
The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different
configurations and services required for the specific domain to be integrated.Â Â

I was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. 
Requirements were fulfilled thru i
 dentifying product
problems and strengths and collected data on customer experienceÂ 
 and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.Â  The next challengeÂ  came as storage requirements for better performance and
more controlled uses. 
After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local
storage to over 200TB. 
In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the
alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,
purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.Â  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30
minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.

As webmaster I was responsible for the wing-to-wing implementation of online solutions for small businesses using the full System
Development Life Cycle. All projects were delivered 100% on time, within budget by correctly assessing needs upfront, and gathering detailed
design specifications that prevent scope creep. I was directly involved in the design/develop/testing phases, the implementing of database systems
using Classic ASP/ASP.net 2.0 and MS SQL Server 2000/2005 in the Windows Hosting environment, PHP 4.0 - 5.0 and MySQL 4 in the Linux
Hosting environment as well as providing support operations, and evaluating the overall system performance after project launch. A few key
ASP.Net/MS SQL 2005 solutions implemented during this period were vendor developed ad tracking and e-mail newsletter marketing software.
Clients relied upon the research and cost benefit analysis provided to determine the best solution that met their needs and budget.

Key responsibilities were to manage the timeliness and accuracy of system parameter setups and data migration of files for private
label and bank card projects. Worked with functional areas such as Marketing, Risk, Fraud, Operations, and Collections to ensure that
parameters implemented met project requirements by serving as the IT lead responsible for overcoming any organizational and technical barriers
that arose. During this period I was able to successfully multi-task and manage several projects concurrently making my role key in the successful
implementation of 14 new portfolios that had a combined growth of $1.26B in new receivables. Implemented successful business-wide initiatives
such as: Ovations! - An associates rewards and recognition system. Primary responsibility was to enhance the system's Graphical User Interface
and make it more intuitive for the users. The completed project resulted in a 50% increase in system productivity while remaining stable during
peak usage periods. This was accomplished by managing the wing-to-wing project implementation with the selected outside vendor and internal IT
teams involved. Kronos TM Workforce Central - Key responsibility was to stabilize the application within the Windows 2k/Oracle 9i
infrastructure by leveraging a test server for validating patches, and major version updates by the vendor. Once moved to the live production
environment, load balancing between 3 application and 1 database server was implemented to better support peak usage times. This allowed the
system to always be available for users to accurately record their time and ensured the Human Resource department they were within 99%
compliance in handling employee payroll. Managed Offshore Resources during several key Intranet initiatives by assisting in the review and
approval of high-level and detail design of business requirements for the enhancements/maintenance of other miscellaneous web applications within
the scope of the Consumer Finance IT build team. After the testing phase was complete I assured the hand off from the build to the production run
team was a seamless transition that did not interrupt any existing production processes. Initiated the role of a technical support contact providing
maintenance and enhancements for three integrated business tracking systems built with classic ASP and MS SQL used to manage the work flow
for a Portfolio Services department of 120 associates. Phases of the application were being built by members of the Information Management
Leadership Program (IMLP), each with specific requirements to implement within their six month rotation. These rotations left a support gap which
I filled to address any system issues as they rose. This resulted in a smoother transition between the IMLP members by allowing them time to focus
on and fulfilling their requirements of the program instead of immediately coming into a new rotation addressing issues left by a previous colleague.
Implemented a database migration plan from MS SQL Server 6.5 to 2000, which included maintenance schedules and archiving. By the structure
of the two versions MS SQL server being completely different, it had to be a two phased approach. Phase one required a migration from 6.5 to
7.0. Phase two was to migrate from 7.0 to 2000. Since support was going to be dropped for MS SQL Server 6.5 the entire project had to be
completed within 30 days. This migration allow me to implement a regularly scheduled maintenance plan that reduced end-user downtime from 10
- 20 hours per month to zero The Subject Matter Expert for the Mid-Range Application group in Stamford responsible for conducting a transfer of
knowledge from the Atlanta data management personnel back to the Mid-Range team for ongoing support. Due to the elimination of curtain
business functions this process had to be successfully completed within 60 days to prevent the possible impact of production systems there after.

At Adsystech I am one of three employees that have a key man insurance policy against them.
This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.
I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a
Service (SaaS) product.
I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed
the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model SaaS.
Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an
exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring
revenue.
I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies
and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.
As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.
Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of
leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.
I'm very proud of the work I've done and Adsystech, below are some key areas in my control: Network Design Monitoring and
Maintenance Cloud Technologies Cyber Security (NITS, CIS, HITRUST/HIPAA) Project Management Technical Support Management
