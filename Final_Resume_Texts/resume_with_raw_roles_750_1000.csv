Performance areas include: Interviewing prospective employees for higher.
Providing daily instruction to warehouse personnel and dispatching drivers for deliveries and pickups.
Routine cycle counts of inventory insure and verify, proper placement of inventory.
Receive all incoming shipments and verify counts create stock locations.
Maintain inventory and quality control procedures.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS Personal: Due to specialized training and procurement practices the City of Peoria had an annual savings of
$1500.00 annually on costs of goods acquired by purchase order during career.
By developing a spreadsheet to record material requisitions and receiving logs, our department was able to stop purchasing preprinted
forms from local vendor, as a result monthly operational cost were reduced.
Man hours during cycle counts and order pulling were also reduced through consolidating bulk inventory into more manageable amounts
with the use of poly-bags rather than just dumping items into bin boxes.
Note: The points mentioned above are a small portion of the ideas introduced during career at City of Peoria.

Purchaser / Production Coordinator
My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and
customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.
In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.
I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these
parts as necessary.
When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate
paperwork to purchasing.
Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.
Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more
closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.
Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.
In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed
accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.
Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where
buyers spend more time on parts themselves.
Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.
I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.
If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.
Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.
We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.
Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.
In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an
industry standard to rise above the competition.
Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.
These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.
Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is
key in this position.

Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist
Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different 
responsibilities.
Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,
Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.
Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.
After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.
If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.
Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.
I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.
Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.
Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.
All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.
I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,
or items that that have already been received.
As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.
As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.
This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.
Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being
ordered and used for an Aircraft.

Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor
I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.
Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.
I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.
This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.
My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.
This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.
I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a
timely fashion.
Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.
I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.
With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.
In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.
This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.
Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.

Company Name
Provides oversight for state operated and private facilities licensed or 
contracted with the Department of Mental Health Developed the
Advocacy Conditional Release Monitoring Program with 
immediate success by locating and reporting consumers that are non-compliant
with medication, court orders and state rules Carefully analyzing historical comments, ratings and input from consumers using 
the grievance
process allowed us to highlight negative trends prior to becoming 
major problems, as a result the number of consumer grievances dropped
almost 
50% since being appointed Advocate General Monitoring and reviewing critical incident reports from facilities resulted in a
collaboration that prompted facility representatives to engage consumers and 
families to offer assistance, an explanation or other appropriate
support that 
soothed initial anger and potentially prevented lawsuits.
This was a huge factor in 
the 34% decrease in critical incidents being reported from 8/2014 to 8/2015 Collaborating with the Oklahoma
Forensic Review Board regarding 
consumers found not guilty by reason of insanity while providing input and 
advice on current behaviors
and trends strengthened relationships between the 
governor appointed board and the department By participating in treatment team
meetings of consumers found not guilty by 
reason of insanity and those never to attain competency, focusing on risk 
assessments,
progression through the program and potential placement for the 
consumers, we were able to streamline the phases of the program making it
more 
productive and efficient Staying aware of the state budget status, I was able to make appropriate 
adjustments while managing this
division's budget.
As a result this division 
finished the fiscal year 20% under budget allowing the savings to be passed on to 
divisions where services were
being cut.

In my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU, I haveÂ drasticallyÂ improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts
Center and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer
Summer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016. 
By changing the way tickets are
marketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have
alsoÂ created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016. I sought and
obtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent improvements to the
aesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment. All of
this was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.

As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I am responsible for
the cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS)
which has been the premierÂ performing arts series in the areaÂ since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCSÂ and my duties
include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration,Â and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting
with and guiding the CCSÂ Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host toÂ a wide
variety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and
Canadian Brass to name a few. 
I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner
Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a
handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements,
incorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series
formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of musicÂ and marketed
as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an
important, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion
National Park.Â  
The second series isÂ an original show called, ""Sanctuary: The Story of Zion"" which was written to correspond with the
centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and
tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be
supported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of
video projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.

As Operations Manager/Owner of Spiral Studios, I was responsible for the daily
management of a busy commercial recording studio. From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to creating production music that has
been featured on such networks as Discovery, Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with a talented staff of
creative minded engineers and musicians.Â  
Spiral Studios has also been involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists
andÂ providing A/V equipment. Â In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and
management.Â  These relationships have allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an entertainer as well as a
director.Â  This knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming. Â I continue to own
Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.

For the past sixteen years I was a leader of change for the largest law firm in the Central Pennsylvania area with over 275 in office users at 6
locations and over 200 work from home users.
I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient,
up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.
The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.
I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of
new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner.
I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as
participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.
I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple
offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.
While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my
vendor negotiation skills.
I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.
My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.
Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile
capability to access our document management system.
I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use
while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times.
Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite.
Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite.
Upgraded the GroupWise Messaging to Outlook Messaging.
Upgraded the Worldox document management system to Worldox GX3.
Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging.
Assisted the Marketing department to implement a firm wide Client Relationship Management (CRM) system.
Setup up Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) systems at two regional offices.
Implemented and upgraded many of100 technical applications and systems used at the firm on an as needed basis to improve efficiency.
Implemented several mobile applications on attorney personal devices to improve efficiency (VPN connectivity, RDP clients, Dictate digital
dictation, Dropbox, Microsoft Office Mobile Suite of applications, Linkedin, Business Card Scanner, Twitter, etc.) The firm experienced
minimum unplanned system downtime under my watch and my team and I oversaw and provided training on the many various applications,
processes and procedures used in business operations.
I am an experienced data security officer with the skills and knowledge to ensure data is adequately protected.
I was the firm's Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations.
It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing ""ease of use"" while ensuring system and data ""security."" Every year
my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review.
Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing
techniques.
I am an experienced project manager with the skill set, knowledge and interpersonal tools required to ensure the timely and efficient
implementation of systems and applications.
I enjoy the aspects of project management as it involves ""cradle to grave"" involvement.
Interacting with the users to determine their technical and budget needs, interacting with vendors, communicating with my peers and self-
study to find the right technology to meet the need, testing the application and processes or feasibility and efficiency, documenting the
processes and procures involved, preparing user instructions and finally implementing and training users on the new system.
I appreciate the resources, processes and procedures required to ensure system efficiency and readiness.
At the firm most applications are hosted at the central office with the regional offices connecting with redundant Ethernet connections, this
saves on the cost of having data centers and support staff at each firm location.
My team and I have also authored the firm's business/continuity/disaster recovery plan for IT applications and systems.
The firm decided the priority and timeliness of systems and applications to recover.
I and my team have configured many IT systems to fail over to the backup systems automatically which is barely noticeable to users.
I served as either the project manager or as a team member in all of the examples expressed in my resume.

I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.
Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on
their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially,
emotionally, physically, and intellectually.
I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with
tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.
Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.
My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.
Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the
direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.
I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.
Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and
themselves.
Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.
Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the
children.
Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a
great feeling.
Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.
Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.
Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.
Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend
more time in school than any other place.
I believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor
activities during the supporting weather.
I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in
outdoor group activities.
A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy
foods, and less sodium and sugar.
I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.
I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of
cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.
Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school
leaving the parents.
My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.
