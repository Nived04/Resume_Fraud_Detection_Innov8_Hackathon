Perform code reviews of the modules developed by other team members and participate in pair programming to improve the coding

Preparation of build packages and actively participate in integration and deployment phase of the applications. TECHNICALS SKILLS:
Programming Languages: C# Web Technologies: SharePoint 2010, ASP.NET 4.0/3.5/2.0, MVC 4 Application Software: Visual Studio
2008/2010/2013, SQL Server Management Studio Databases: SQL Server 2005/2008 R2, MySQL, Oracle Others: HTML, JQuery,
CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JIRA Source Controls: Team Foundation Sever, GitHub, Visual Source Safe PROJECTS AT WORK: 1)
LEDGER: Ledger is developed to manage the task of invoice clearance for different finance benefits trust accounts of Pratt & Whitney. It is
also used to track invoices charged back to the department budget or to the various business units. The primary objective of this project
was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding
additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on
certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax.
UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee
id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will
decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception
records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3)
Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of
seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can
access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the
main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL
Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two
parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The
existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and
approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to
capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to
validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a
web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an
ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk
data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data
that can be uploaded into each column. AWARDS AND PROFESSIONAL RECOGNITION:

Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.

COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 
05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! 
This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 
06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 
06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the petty thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred. My
best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks to
my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months I had was when I sold 199 phones and over 
$3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet. Fulfilled all supervisory duties when Store Manager
was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them for
helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I am today.

Summary
I am passionate about teaching and caring for students holistically. I believe it is crucial for students to develop critical thinking skills as they
develop their sense of self and their worldview. I prioritize teacher collaboration to develop a community among educators and to develop best
practices. I pursue professional development opportunities to better serve all of my students with an emphasis on equity, differentiation and inquiry-
based learning. I have recently completed my National Board Certification pending results in January of 2019.

I have worked at Lakes High School in the Clover Park School District for the past five years. In my time at Lakes, I have taught 9th grade, 11th
grade and 12th grade English as well as AP Literature and AP Language. Due to some teacher turnover and the adapting needs of the English
department, I have had the opportunity to build my experience across grade levels and develop curriculum after curriculum to suit the needs of
students at various ages. As a result, I believe one of my greatest strengths is my understanding of the skills necessary at each grade level for
students to successfully exist high school career or college-ready.

areas of logistical support ranging from safety of equipment and personnel to proper shipping and handling of material. Several characteristics and

To Whom It May Concern, 
The intent of this letter is to express my
professional regards for Mr.
William Hale.
I have known Mr.
Hale for over 
a year in 
academic milieu.
During this period I have had the pleasure of being associated with one of the finest people that anyone 
could ever come in contact with.
William's technical and professional prowess has accorded him the highest regards from his peers.
He has a thorough 
understanding of the job requirements and how to accomplish corporate goals without sacrificing individual creativity.
William is not only a success in his career, but is always interested in the betterment of his fellow man.
I have observed him many times in the process of accomplishing things that truly are representative of a person with a strong 
family and
moral convictions.
William is a man that can wear many hats, and his humbleness allows him to be a good server, 
and at times adapt to the position of a leader.
I am deeply impressed by Mr.
Hale and recommend him unhesitatingly.
I am confident that, if selected for your vacancy, he

Yours,

The dojo I work at was sold to new owners in 2015; I stayed on board with the new owners and have improved many areas of their
business.
The biggest improvements I made were things that save them money.Â  The martial arts school I work at used a website that charged them
$300 a month for information that was just not needed and therefore a waste of money.Â  I came up with our own in house system.
I identified what information (tuition, attendance, rank, student's info etc.) we needed on a daily basis, and how to get to that information
quickly.Â  I simply used the excel program, came up with a sheet for each class and modify it to be easy to use for anyone.
We can access any information we need quickly and timely; without paying this website.
We were paying a lot for internet and phone.Â  I called around and verified price and contract for a commercial account.Â  I was able to
negotiate a great price and bundle our services.
We sell a lot of merchandise at the martial arts gym.Â  I set up all new whole sale accounts; for equipment and uniform needs.Â  I
researched pricing for equipment, uniforms and office needs (ink, paper, paper towels) and modified our suppliers.Â  I was able to establish
new relationships and new pricing.
The dojo relocated in 2016.Â  When we took over a new space; I planned everything.Â  The bathroom remodel I came up with the
complete redesign and ,some of the construction, I actually did myself.
I handled every aspect of moving from one location to a new location.Â  In a time limit of 14 days, we not only moved but opened our
doors at new location; all during Christmas/New Year Holiday.
Since working for ATA, I have revised the way we communicate to students and parents.Â  I updated our facebook web page, came out
with a monthly newsletter, put in place an announcement board, and update our webpage bi-weekly.
I have planned and executed new rank testings, tournaments, birthday parties, and planned our company events for an entire year in
advance.
I have increased customer satisfaction and supported customers in areas such as conflict resolution in tuition issues, problem solved our
cancel and hold policy, resolved our turnaround time on merchandise orders, clarified rules and equipment requirements in writing and
revamped our leadership program.
IÂ manage new student recruitment, marketing needs, student registration, community outreach, parent communications, staff management,ordering supplies, bookkeeping, upgrade selling, and receiving payments Improved family and parent relations for the school.Â  I created
and implemented new schedule, new calendar of events, worked closely with the owners to design and publish the company's website

I manage the billings to our clients and follow through so that collection is made on time to ensure that the Company has the appropriate

On the financial reporting, I prepare detailed reports with supporting schedules such as 15-month expenditure budget with estimates and

As a certified fitness trainer my expertise has evolved by working with all different types of people; the young, the elderly, the weak, the
strong, the couch potato, the professional athlete, the stay at home mom/dad, the workaholic, the rich and famous and the down to earth, all
who have a similar goal in mind - Strength and fitness for a healthy lifestyle.
I developed of a beach workout called ""Beach Plyo"" which incorporates cardio, plyometric training, endurance, strength training and
coordination. Â 
 It is a total body workout in the soft sand which utilizes weighted balls, hurdles, ladders, plyometric jump boxes, exercise
bands, etc..Â 
 
It is an intense class for those seeking something off the main grid and want a bit of a challenge.
I have also developed specific programs for the elderly so that they stay mentally and physically fit therefore preventing injury and/or illness.
In geriatric training there are two main focuses: Balance/Gait and muscle development.
Through exercise routines consisting of standing balancing exercises, vision exercises, water therapy, walking, stationary cycling, yoga,
pilates, tai chi and basic strength exercises they can accomplish increased muscleÂ 
 strength, bone strength and their ability to walk and
move.
By keeping them active and physically strong improves their overall quality of life.
I have also taught, coached and trained young children and teenagers in specific sports as well as for overall fitness.
I have coached kids in track and field, soccer, softball, swimming and cross country.
I love the simple competitive nature of kids.
I enjoy finding ways to keep them motivated while keeping it fun.
It is incredibly rewarding to watch them reaching goals they never thought was possible.
Being a fitness trainer allows me to share my knowledge and experience with others and it also keeps me focused, balanced and organized.
I have chosen an overall healthy lifestyle that I believe is inspirational to those I train plus it gives me the energy I need to give them my
absolute best.

Executive Profile
I am a self-motivated and patient focused nurse executive with a strong history of progressive leadership. I have worked in health care for the past
12 years and in nursing for the past 9. I have been honored to quickly and progressively build upon my experiences to assume key leadership
positions. These opportunities have allowed me to lead the charge on increased facility efficiency and cost savings, while ensuring stellar quality
programming with a focus on infection control, risk management, and quality improvement. Under my direction, organizational improvements in
those areas have flourished while experiencing record surgical volume and implementation of new and innovative procedures. Change under
pressure has been staple in my professional life, and an aspect that has quickly molded me in to a quick-witted yet careful professional; always
putting the patient first, but never losing sight of strategic goals to ensure organizational success.

I started out as a Customer Service Rep 3 and worked my way to a rep 2, and then a Rep 1 before we changed the Rep system to a 1234.
When doing this we answered customer calls in regards to account balances, transaction review, disputes, wire transfers, statement request,
Online banking issues, Western Unions, ETC.
I went to a position in QCD for approximately 3 months.
Where we revamped QA and turned it into QCD Quality Coaching and Development.
We each had our own teams that were made of multiple Supervisors and their employees.
Reviewed calls for performance and compliance to procedures.
Met with each person on my team monthly and reviewed and coached the agents on calls and met with each Supervisor on each of their
employees.
After a short leave of absence I came back and started as a rep 3 and moved to a rep 4 and then to a Lead position.
Where I had to answer Lead and Supervisor calls, as well as manage the floor for my Supervisor.
I then moved to the Outbound team where I was there in the beginning of the team development.
This was a Pilot program that exceeded the expectations and was opened as a division after the first 3 months instead of the 6 month
allocated for development.
We started the division and created the procedures, as we went along.
This was a Sales position in which we contacted customers with new accounts to ensure they are welcomed to the family, as well as to fulfill
their individual financial needs.
After the first 6 months I was acknowledged by the Board of Directors as a Pillar of Success for the company in Account Retention and
New Account Acquisition.
During the first 6 months I was shown to compile 50.4% of the work load for the Outbound team of 5 members.
I continued to Lead the team in sales for the first implementation of new hires and stayed a top performer until I left the department.
I then went to the Online Team as a Rep II.
I currently provide a first line of support for the Online manager.
I monitor the floor to maintain order and answer any questions if I am the designated Rep II for the day.
Run credit cards for account funding, assist in account openings if needed, communicate effectively with the agents on the floor and any
other interdepartmental interactions, review and log all mailings outgoing, send account denials, review and log the incoming documents,
assist with tasks should they get behind, handle and log Supervisor chats, assist occasionally in training of employees.

Performance areas include: Interviewing prospective employees for higher.
Providing daily instruction to warehouse personnel and dispatching drivers for deliveries and pickups.
Routine cycle counts of inventory insure and verify, proper placement of inventory.
Receive all incoming shipments and verify counts create stock locations.
Maintain inventory and quality control procedures.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS Personal: Due to specialized training and procurement practices the City of Peoria had an annual savings of
$1500.00 annually on costs of goods acquired by purchase order during career.
By developing a spreadsheet to record material requisitions and receiving logs, our department was able to stop purchasing preprinted
forms from local vendor, as a result monthly operational cost were reduced.
Man hours during cycle counts and order pulling were also reduced through consolidating bulk inventory into more manageable amounts
with the use of poly-bags rather than just dumping items into bin boxes.
Note: The points mentioned above are a small portion of the ideas introduced during career at City of Peoria.

Accomplishments
Our ship was in trouble when the right terminal shaft of the woodward governor that connects the governor to the injection pumps was
broken while we were Somewhat near the Aleutian island in Alaska. The emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. I
suggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. Then we were able to reach safely the port
of Ketchikan, Alaska.
When the power turbine blades of one of our Gas Turbine Engine 
were all broken, our chief Engineer asked me if we can replace it? This
procedure were never done before me. I studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate
the compressor from the combustion chamber. We recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that
hold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.
There was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis
plant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary
convert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and
timers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the
equipment and resume our much needed operation.

When you are writing letters, it's important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.
Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.
It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter
doesn't fit well on a page.
Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.
Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.
Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.
It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.
Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your
cover letter.
Here's how to space your cover letter.
When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.
If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar.

You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.
How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your
cover letter.
Highlight the content of your letter.

Statecover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.
Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to
devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.
A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.
Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.
A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.
Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.
There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The
prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance
in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each
position you seek.
Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).
Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences
(remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).
The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.
Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.
Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.
