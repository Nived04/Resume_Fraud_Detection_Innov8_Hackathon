While working in Chicago Bakery I accepted payment from customers and gave the correct amount of change as needed. Cleaned up spilled
food, drinks and broken dishes, and removed empty bottles and trash. I also took cake orders over the phone and maintained store cleanliness
throughout the day. Stock baked good in the display cases. At the end of the day I would close the store and make sure that nothing is out of
place and baked goods are stored away properly.
Accomplishments
When I first started to work for Boost Mobile I didn't know a thing about sales or phones at all. I was so insecure about everything, until one day I
decided to put all the insecurity thoughts aside and show my true strength and confidence. My sale skills went from zero to none to one hundred.
My best day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks
to my coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team
player and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months was when I sold 145 phones and over $3,088 worth in
accessories. Routinely helped as many as ten customers each day in a high-volume retail outlet.I also fulfilled all supervisory duties when the store
manager was on vacation. I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them
for helping me develop my skills and making me into the person I know I am.

During my four years of high school I struggle a lot to manage my grades and make sure that I would be on the right path to achieve my goals but
some how I would always let something get in the way of my goal. Until one day my counselor and my favorite teacher came to me with help. They
helped me plan out everything that I wanted to accomplish before I graduated, with the right push and motivation I was able to achieve my goal. I
managed to get all A's, B's and C's.
